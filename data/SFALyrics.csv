Pumpkin roots and all winter's ravages 
She came in around dawn 
Took her coat off 
Burdened down by the Russian winter 
Felt the warmth of the hearth 
Bathed a while naked in hot water 
Wash away imminent disaster 
Thinking through her today 
And the murder 
Of the bailiff and the landowner 
Felt no shame 
Only gain 

Cleansed the pike 
Peeled all the potatoes 
Beetroots ripe for bellies of gigolos 
Served it up for her son and her daughter 
For the last time she imagines 
Reprobates lie in wait

I don't need no inoculation 
I just jump in my car and go 
For how long? 
I do not know 
The Euro Zone is my home 
Passed my driving test last year 
You know it took me a while to get there 
It was my fourth time around 
And I was in perfect mind of sound 
Underneath my chair is the road to her 

[At this point I switch my radio on] 
If it's not crap trance on the radio 
Then it's problem rock on every show 
You know they're go no more lows to go 
They're making too much money 
And taking too much Blow 
Your mind is behind

Fly away in my silver Bluebird 
Sleep in lay-bys on the way

Well it's Solvent Abuse Awareness Week 
At the clinic in a Berlin backyard 
Sleek as the big lump on my head 
I could really do with a bath and a bed 
But underneath my chair 
Is the road to her 

[So I just head on for Poland, and, er...] 
Reach my destination with no satellite navigation system 
Just a map and a clear mind 
If I run out of bucks 
Maybe I'll drive a truck 
But it's a lonely way to make some pay

An eye doctor to help her cyst, 
She took the wrong turn, 
to the family planning. 

Saw Lord Lucan riding Shergar 
to the shops last night, 
Couldn't be positive in

Chased them in a Mustang

There was the mountain 
It was a big fucking mountain 
So I climbed the mountain 
It was no ordinary mountain 
It was a strange-looking mountain 
But when I got to the top it was two foot tall 
It was oh so small 

But coming down from my mountain 
There was nothing to stop me 
Prepared for the future 
Accomplished back left behind me 
With a (???) tentpole 
I move on gradually 
My ship was leaking 
""No danger,"" I said, ""you can use my compass instead"" 

From a ring-o-ring-o-roses

From a (???)

I wasn't looking for a mountain 
There was the mountain 
It was a big fucking mountain 
So I climbed the mountain 
It was no ordinary mountain

But when I got to the top it was two foot tall 
It was oh so small 

My mind was scrambling 
For a thought that was happening 
Do we need more than diplomacy 
To get us through tragedy 
One thing is for sure 
You can't beat solidarity 
So on my return it was clear as day, it was all okay 

I looked for the mountain 
There's always a mountain 
So make a molehill from the mountain (???) 
And banish all mountains 
Now there's no more mountains 
What else can there be?
